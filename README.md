# 🎓 University Projects Portfolio

This repository showcases the projects I've developed throughout my university studies, covering a range of topics and technologies. Each project includes a brief overview, key objectives, and relevant code or resources. These projects reflect my growth in programming, problem-solving, and my passion for exploring various domains in computer science and software engineering.

Feel free to explore and reach out if you have any questions!

## 🗂️ Project Highlights

| Project | Description | Technologies |
| ------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| **ShelterManager** | A comprehensive application designed to streamline the operations of an animal shelter, including adoption requests, donation management, and receipt generation. Designed with a focus on usability, data management, and separation of concerns through MVC and DAO design patterns. | `UML`, `MVC Pattern`, `DAO Pattern`, `SQL` |
| **SNMP & Telegram Bot Integration** | A Node.js application integrating SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) for network device monitoring with a Telegram bot interface. Users can scan for SNMP devices, retrieve device data, monitor CPU load, uptime, and track network traffic, all via Telegram commands. | `Javascript`, `Node.js`, `net-snmp`, `Telegram Bot API`, `Chart.js` |
| **e-crops** | An arcade-style simulation game built from scratch in C, where players maintain a virtual garden by watering, fertilizing, and tending to different types of plants. The game introduces a limited number of actions per day, challenging players to manage resources strategically. | `C`, `POSIX Threads`, `File Handling`, `System Clock` |
| **AutoTrack PI: Autonomous Line-Following Car** | The project involves developing an autonomous line-following car that uses infrared sensors to detect and follow a predefined path. It incorporates a proportional-integral (PI) control system to maintain the car's alignment along the path. Key challenges, including wheel speed inconsistencies and environmental sensitivity of sensors, are addressed to improve stability and reliability under varying conditions. | `PI Control`, `Infrared Sensors`, `Bluetooth Comunication`, `Arduino` |
> [!NOTE]
> All the documentation is in spanish because it has been done while studying Telecommunications Engineering degree at the University of Seville.
